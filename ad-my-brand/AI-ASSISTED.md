# AI-Assisted Development Report

## Overview
This project was developed with minimal AI assistance, primarily for quick troubleshooting and best practice validation.

## AI Usage Summary

### Font Import Issues (5 minutes)
- **Issue**: TypeScript errors with `Geist` and `Geist_Mono` imports from `next/font/google`
- **AI Assistance**: Suggested using `Inter` font instead, which is properly supported
- **Implementation**: Replaced problematic font imports with standard Google Fonts

### Responsive Design Consultation (10 minutes)
- **Issue**: Needed quick reference for Tailwind responsive breakpoints
- **AI Assistance**: Provided mobile-first responsive class suggestions
- **Implementation**: Applied responsive utilities for mobile optimization

### Code Structure Validation (5 minutes)
- **Issue**: Wanted to confirm Next.js 14 App Router best practices
- **AI Assistance**: Validated layout structure and metadata configuration
- **Implementation**: Maintained existing structure as it followed current standards

## Development Approach
The majority of the development was done independently, with AI serving as a quick reference tool rather than a primary development partner. The core architecture, component design, and business logic were implemented without AI assistance.

## Time Saved
Approximately 20 minutes of debugging and documentation lookup time was saved through targeted AI queries.
