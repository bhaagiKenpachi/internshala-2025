Frontend Developer Test Assignment
Position: React + Next.js Frontend Developer​
Platform (Dummy): Artistly.com​
Assignment Type: Individual | Work-from-anywhere​
Estimated Duration: ~10-12 hours over 2 days​
Submission Deadline: 4:00 PM IST, Wednesday, 25th June 2025

✨ PROJECT OVERVIEW: Artistly.com (Dummy App for Assignment)
You are assigned to create a 3-4 page functional and mobile-responsive web demo of a
fictional platform called Artistly.com, a Performing Artist Booking Platform.
Artistly.com is designed for Event Planners and Artist Managers to connect. Event planners
can browse through artist profiles, shortlist their preferences, and raise booking/availability
requests. Artist Managers can onboard artists, receive booking leads, and manage responses
via a dashboard.
The actual backend and database logic is out of scope—for now, use static JSON files or mock
APIs. Focus entirely on frontend engineering quality using React + Next.js, with best
practices in routing, responsiveness, UI rendering, and folder structure.

ShadCN or other open UI components
Free UI templates (suggested below)
Host it for free on Vercel.com
You are not being evaluated on UI creativity or design polish. Instead, we are
testing your coding structure, responsiveness, code safety, performance
optimization, form logic, data handling, and ability to compose a real-world UI
using React + Next.js.
