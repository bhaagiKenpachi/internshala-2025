# Personal Finance Visualizer 💰

Hey there! 👋 I built this personal finance tracker to help people manage their money better. It's a comprehensive web app that lets you track expenses, set budgets, and get insights into your spending habits.

## 🌟 What's Special About This App?

I wanted to create something that's not just another expense tracker, but a complete financial companion. Here's what makes it different:

### 📊 **Smart Analytics**
- Beautiful charts that actually make sense
- Real-time insights about your spending patterns
- Budget vs actual comparisons that help you stay on track

### 🎯 **Three-Stage Approach**
I built this in stages, each adding more powerful features:

**Stage 1: Basic Tracking**
- Simple transaction management (add, edit, delete)
- Monthly expense visualization
- Clean, intuitive interface

**Stage 2: Categories & Insights**
- Predefined spending categories
- Category breakdown with pie charts
- Dashboard with summary cards
- Recent transactions overview

**Stage 3: Budgeting & Smart Insights**
- Monthly category budgets
- Budget vs actual comparison charts
- Spending insights and recommendations
- Overspending alerts

## 🛠️ Built With

I chose these technologies because they work great together:

- **Next.js 14** - For the framework (love the App Router!)
- **TypeScript** - Because type safety is a lifesaver
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling (utility-first approach rocks)
- **shadcn/ui** - Beautiful, accessible components
- **Recharts** - For those smooth, interactive charts
- **Local State** - For now, but ready for MongoDB integration

- Month selector for historical analysis

## 🚀 Deployment

I deployed this on Vercel because it's super easy and works great with Next.js:

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Import your repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect Next.js and deploy

3. **Your app will be live at**
   ```
   https://your-project-name.vercel.app
   ```

## 🎯 What's Next?

I have some ideas for future improvements:
- [ ] MongoDB integration for data persistence
- [ ] User accounts and authentication
- [ ] Export data to CSV/PDF
- [ ] Recurring transactions
- [ ] Goal setting and tracking
- [ ] Mobile app version
- [ ] Advanced analytics and reports
